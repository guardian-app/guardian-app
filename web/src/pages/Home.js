                            Nowadays, the biggest problem parents are facing is that when their children leave beyond their eyesight, they canâ€™t ensure their safety. Guardian is addressing this problem and giving a solution to the parents. Using location history, parents also can view the places where their children have visited. Using real-time location tracking, if the child visits an unsafe location parent will get alerted so they can take immediate action. Parents can specify safe-areas, or Geo-fences easily using our system.
                            Parents would be provided a web application along with the mobile application companion to monitor their children. The children would require to have the mobile application installed on their mobile device.
